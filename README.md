## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/) for fluid responsiveness

### What I did differently

The design for this challenge contained three different sizes. After learning about the design tool, [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/), and how easy it makes building truly responsive designs, I decided not to use media queries in my solution therefore foregoing the tablet design. The solution still adheres to the design on tablets, it's just not pixel perfect but this is a small price to pay for less boilerplate code.

### Useful resources

- [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/) for fluid responsiveness, saves having to use media queries.
